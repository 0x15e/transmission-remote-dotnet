#summary Screenshots

Here's a screenshot of it connected to my virtual server downloading some ubuntu images. On my home machine I don't firewall transmission-daemon and connect directly, but on this host I choose to firewall it and port forward over SSH which is why it's connected to localhost.

I've heard of a windows version of transmission-daemon, but it seems very experimental. I've only ever used transmission-daemon on Linux.
