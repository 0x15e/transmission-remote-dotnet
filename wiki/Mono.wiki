#summary Instructions and issues relating to using transmission-remote-dotnet on Mono

*News 18/02/09*: From 3.5, I will be aiming to get the standard binaries to _run_ on Mono. Due to Mono's winforms implementation it's quite experimental/unsupported/sluggish.

Here's a list of issues that I've noticed on Mono:

1) On older versions of mono/transmission/both, authentication doesn't work.

2) Mono's winforms is sometimes sluggish and ugly.

3) The main window needs a minor resize each time it's opened so that the whole ToolStrip is visible.

4) Minimising to tray seems to lose all the ToolStrip items on some Mono verisons.

A GTK# UI would be nice. Trying to port everything all at once would probably be quite hard. If I had the time, I'd get a skeleton of a UI working, then move the more reusable pieces of code like the CommandFactory, Torrent, ProtocolConstants, and Command classes. The UI glue would probably need to be rewritten.

To build for Mono:

1) Do a svn checkout.

2) Open the sln file in MonoDevelop or Visual Studio (no makefile yet).

3) It may be necessary to remove the two Jayrock references and re-add them (from TransmissionClientNew/bin/Release)

4) Define the MONO symbol in project options.

5) Build and run.
