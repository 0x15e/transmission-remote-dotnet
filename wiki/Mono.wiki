#summary Instructions and issues relating to using transmission-remote-dotnet on Mono

The 3.8 binaries will not run on mono for now. I'll probably release a mono build at the end of the month when I've got time. Using the steps below, it should still build for mono.

Here's a list of issues that I've noticed on Mono:

1) Mono's winforms is often sluggish and ugly.

2) The main window needs a minor resize each time it's opened so that the whole ToolStrip is visible.

3) Minimising to tray seems to lose all the ToolStrip items on some Mono verisons.

A GTK# UI would be nice. Trying to port everything all at once would probably be quite hard. If I had the time, I'd get a skeleton of a UI working, then move the more reusable pieces of code like the CommandFactory, Torrent, ProtocolConstants, and Command classes. The UI glue would probably need to be rewritten.

To build for Mono:

1) Do a svn checkout.

2) Open the sln file in MonoDevelop or Visual Studio (no makefile yet).

3) It may be necessary to remove the two Jayrock references and re-add them (from TransmissionClientNew/bin/Release)

4) Define the MONO symbol in project options.

5) Build and run.
