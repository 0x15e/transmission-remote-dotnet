#summary Instructions and issues relating to using transmission-remote-dotnet on Mono

[http://transmission-remote-dotnet.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screenshot-3.4mono-1.small.png]

Here's a list of issues that I've noticed on Mono:

1) Mono's winforms is often sluggish and ugly.

2) The main window needs a minor resize each time it's opened so that the whole ToolStrip is visible.

3) Minimising to tray seems to lose all the ToolStrip items on some Mono verisons.

4) Selecting multiple file items works, but right clicking causes only one to be selected.

To build for Mono:

1) Do a svn checkout.

2) Open the sln file in MonoDevelop or Visual Studio (no makefile yet).

3) It may be necessary to remove the two Jayrock references and re-add them (from TransmissionClientNew/bin/Release)

4) Define the MONO symbol in project options.

5) Build and run.
